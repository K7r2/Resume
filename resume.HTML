                            This is a project used to create a simple database using a linked list and
                            Arraylist <br>.You can insert employees and their information. Also, you can search for
                            employee
                            <br>by entering his ID and entering the button search
                            In the same position, you can enter <br>an employee ID and then press the delete button to
                            delete the employee from <br>the database

                            ID

                            As we see in the video
                            The Project for Bookstore
                            When you run the code <br>
                            a menu with 7 options will display
                            The first option for customers to registers
                            That will <br> ask you for some information like
                            Customer's full name , ID number <br> and phone number
                            The second option will show you the available books in the library <br> with their
                            names,book
                            types {action, dramaâ€¦etc}, published date , and book price per day <br>so you can choose one
                            of
                            the available books for the customer, also all the books are <br> numbered
                            So if you want to choose a book just enter his number
                            The third option is to <br>rent a book
                            in this option, you need to choose the customer and the books id numbers <br> that the
                            customer
                            want, and you need to enter the number of rent days because the <br>number of days will
                            multiply
                            with the book price per day
                            Also, we have a special <br> characteristic in this project: if the customer rents more than
                            3
                            times he will get <br>a %15 discount
                            The fourth option will display all registered customers in <br>the system
                            The fifth option will display the chosen books
                            The sixth option will <br>display all rent operation
                            The seventh option will exit <a href="projectCode.pdf">see the source code</a>
